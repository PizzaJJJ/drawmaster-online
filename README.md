Tool for creating lines based images. Line is simply an array of numbers like ```[y1, x1, y0, x0]```. Whole image is an array of such lines, like: 
```Javascript
[
    [45, 36, 89, 30],
    [12, 68, 44, 77],
    ...
]
```

The tool is primarily intended for creating arrays of lines to draw in such games like cursors.io.

It's possible to upload existing image lines array or a background image via drag-n-drop.
